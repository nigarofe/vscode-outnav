Book Live More Think Less
	Origin prompt
		Search for books that talk specifically about how to deal with thoughts about thoughts. For example, for those who try to optimize so much the instructions that they give to themselves that this actually can make harm
	Notes
		Your problem is not your negative thoughts but first and foremost too much thinking
		It is impossible to think yourself to fewer ruminations.
		‘You cannot walk away from a door you are trying to hold closed.’ You cannot get away from a thought you are trying to hold on to
		It is not the scale of the problem that determines how long a person spends dwelling on it, but rather the person themselves who makes this evaluation.
		The problem does not lie in the fact that we have thoughts, and therefore the solution is not to repress them.
		‘Do all you can to do nothing.’ This means that the less you do with your thoughts, the better off you will be.
	S-REF model (Self-Regulatory Executive Function Model of Emotional Disorder) p19
		1. Lower level: automatic thoughts and images
		2. Middle level: strategies
		3. Metacognitive beliefs level: assumptions about our thoughts and thought processes
	CAS (Cognitive Attentional Syndrome) p24
		Strategies
			Rumination
			Worry
			Monitoring behavior
	Five metagcognitive beliefs p36
		A. I am not aware of my ruminations (lack of awareness)
		B. My rumination in uncontrollable (without control)
		C. I can't act without motivation (passivity)
		D. If I ruminate, I can find solutions ans answers (usefulness)
		E. Depression is a biological disease that I can't influence (biology)
	Trigger thoughts pop into your head. Now you have a choice. What do you do? p61
			A. Deferral - Setting a rumination time. 
				Ruminate and process - but for a set period of time, postponing thinking until that time.
				Before and after rumination time, I suggest that clients use methods B and C.
			B. Controlling attention
				Move your focus to what is happening around you or to your activity
			C. Be mindful but detached
				Let the thoughts be (detached mindfulness) p42
				Train of thought open it's doors: I can board it or not
				Sushi conveyor belt: You can choose to reach for them or let them pass by.
